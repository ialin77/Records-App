# Records-App

Records-App is a simple app where you can add your records.
For the Records App, I used the Python language for all functionalities, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the project.

The only app of the project is called 'webapp' where I integrated the functionalities such as adding records, updating or deleting them, and the functionality of login or register

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates used in this project weren't created by me and the website design wasn't a priority for me, I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
